    description: `Donald Duck (or simply referred to as “The Duck”) is an animated character created by Walt Disney as a foil to Mickey Mouse. Making his screen debut in The Wise Little Hen on June 9, 1934, Donald is characterized as a pompous, showboating duck wearing a sailor suit, cap and a bow tie. Along with his semi-unintelligible voice (as famously created by his original voice actor, Clarence "Ducky" Nash), Donald’s most dominant trait is his fiery temper, which is predominantly expressed through explosive tantrums and fits of quacking and squawking. Much of Donald’s anger stems from his exceptionally bad luck, though his misfortunes are often the karmic result of his own arrogance and greed.`,

Initially intended to serve as a one-time appearances, Joker's instant popularity ensured that the character would continue to appear, becoming a frequent enemy of the Dark Knight and Robin, the Boy Wonder. By the late 1940s, Joker had been reimagined as a harmless prankster. Falling into obscurity by the 1960s, he was re-introduced in the 1970s as a more legitimate threat and one of the most infamous criminals within Gotham City. In recent years, the character has taken on the persona of an evil-incarnate, simply taking joy in tormenting Batman or trying to push him into villainy.`,

The two lived on Wundagore Mountain in Eastern Europe, believing themselves born as mutants to a Romani couple named the Maximoffs. Given the name Wanda, she lived for a short time in childish innocence until local troubles involving her parents separated her and her brother from them and forced her to hide her growing powers. Nearing adulthood, Wanda and Pietro fell under the wing of the criminal Magneto and as the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver they joined his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Following violent clashes between the group and the heroic X-Men, the siblings struck out on their own, unhappy with their alliance with Magneto and unsure of their future. When the founding members of the Avengers disbanded, leaving Captain America to continue the team, Wanda and Pietro accepted an invitation of membership, hoping the Avengers might help them reverse their reputations as villains.`,

In the sequel The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea, she serves as the deuteragonist. She has vivid flowing red hair and aqua blue eyes. When she was a mermaid she had green fins and a lavender seashell bra. She is voiced by Jodi Benson. Ariel was the 16-year-old daughter of the sea king, King Triton, who hated humans. However, she wanted to know more about humans and was fascinated by them. Her goal was set when she fell in love with a human prince Eric. Desperate, she traded her voice with the sea witch Ursula for human legs, which would last for three days. Before the sunset of the third day, she had to let Prince Eric kiss her with true love's kiss in order for her to become human permanently. However, Ursula kept thwarting Ariel's plans. By the third day, Ursula changed into a human with Ariel's voice, enchanting the prince. Nonetheless, Ariel had her voice back, but her father was changed into a polyp, and Ursula gained control of the trident and the seven seas. In the end, Eric stabbed Ursula with a broken ship, killing her. King Triton felt sympathy for his daughter and bestowed her with legs.`,

While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.
    Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.`,

The story is about the adventures of a young ten-year-old girl named Chihiro as she wanders into the world of the gods and spirits. She is forced to work at a bathhouse following her parents being turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba.
    The film was made to please the ten-year-old daughter of Hayao Miyazaki's personal friend, director Seiji Okuda. Okuda's daughter even became the model for the film's protagonist, Chihiro. During the film's planning phase, Miyazaki gathered the daughters of Ghibli's staff in a mountain hut in Shinano Province to hold a training seminar. His experience led him to wanting to make a film for them, since he had never made a movie for girls at the age of 10.`,
